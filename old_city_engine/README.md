# CITY ENGINE

A city is made of multiples structures: 

* Factories (n by user)
* Storages (one by user)
* and Finally operations (n by factories)

Idea is: 

An operation will generate ressources (picking item(s) from storage, and adding new items into the storage).
An user may have multiples factories, generating various items. Ultimately, factories will be thematised (thus a "Forest" will only be able to have "Harvest Wood" like operations generating wood from nothing, while Lumbermill will have "Create Planks" like operation generating planks from wood.)

The storage, warehouse, is unique for each user, allowing factories to pool ressources.
